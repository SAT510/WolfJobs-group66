# Introduction

Eager to dive into a side hustle or seize a full-time job opportunity? Look no further than WolfJobs. Our platform is the ultimate connector between recruiters in need of talent for both short-term and full-time roles and candidates seeking the freedom to choose. Dive in, earn your share, and opt out whenever you want ‚Äì or stay on for a longer journey!

The job market for students seeking short-term roles lacks dedicated platforms, as traditional portals overwhelm users with permanent listings and complicate applications with inconsistent formats and poor job matching. The WolfJobs job portal aims to connect the student fraternity with the recruiters for both temporary and full-time job openings. The different recruiters can post temporary jobs, for which candidates apply without bothering about permanent associations.

# Newly Enhanced Features

Email Services: Implemented an automated notification system that sends acceptance and rejection emails to applicants, ensuring clear and timely communication at every stage of the application review process.

Deadline-Based Filter and Tags: Introduced a filter to sort applications by approaching deadlines and added tags displaying the number of days remaining until the deadline, helping users effectively prioritize their application process.

Job Management for Managers: Added features that allow managers to edit and delete job details after posting, providing greater flexibility and control over job listings.

Database Security and Hashing: Enhanced database security by implementing JWT for secure login and signup processes, along with password hashing to protect user credentials and ensure data security.

Browser Extension: Developed a browser extension that integrates with the cloud MongoDB database to display job pop-ups linked to job titles on our platform, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Application Status Tracking: Enhanced features to display real-time application statuses‚ÄîNot Applied, Accepted, Rejected, or In-Review‚Äîon the applicant's end, ensuring transparency at every stage of the process.

# Future Scope

**1. Interview Video Submission** - Managers can request applicants to submit a video screening file and applicants can upload a video on their side of the portal.

**2. Job Analysisüîç** ‚Äì WolfJobs will provide the functionality of analysing various aspects of a job. Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

**3. Chatbot Integrationü§ñ** ‚Äì Our platform WolfJobs will also provide the functionality of Chatbot integrated with our website so that user can easily interact with the bot and get to know about various features of our web application and have a nice interactive experience.

**4. Interview Appointment SchedulingüìÜ** ‚Äì WolfJobs will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant‚Äôs availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.

**5. Browser Extension Enhancement**: Extend the browser extension to be integrated with the backend and show the complete job pop-up. Additionally, add an auto-fill feature based on the job information that would simplify data entry, enhancing user-friendliness and efficiency.

**6. Matching based on Resume** ‚Äì WolfJobs applicants will be able to parse their resume and WolfJobs will extract key skills from the resume and compare it with required job skills to give candidates job matching status.

**7. Community Features**: Introduce a forum or discussion board where users can share experiences, ask questions, and provide advice on job applications and interviews. This could foster a community around job hunting and reviews.
